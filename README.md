# spanningSeeds
Number of output sequences from a fibonacci linear feedback shift register whose feedback polynomial coefficients (excluding the constant term) correspond to the binary representation of n
Can be thought of as a Pseudorandom number generator algorithm - Determine the number of seeds needed to reach every possible generated number for a given taps, or set of taps'

# explanation 
See background, if you are not familiar with pseudorandom number generation
Number of different sequences generated from a fibonacci linear feedback shift register with starting taps=binary representation of the given integer
Determine the number of different seed resets needed to generate all possible numbers. So if a number generation enters a cycle (generates a number a second time),
restart it with a new seed to reach all possible numbers. Program determines number of restarts needed per seed (or a range of seeds). Solved in O(n) time
# Background on random numbers 
Random numbers can be generated by a computer in the following way: 
A tap is chosen (any positive integer)
Another positive integer (a seed) is chosen as the first random number with the same number of bits in its binary representation as the tap
The next number is generated by eliminating the highest bit of the seed, moving all the other bits over to the right by one, and making the first bit
the dot product of the binary representations of the taps and the seed (mod 2). Every further number is generated by the same process, but instead of the seed,
using the last generated random number
Ex. set tap to 5, and seed to 3. So tap = [1 0 1] in binary and seed = [1 1 0]. So next number is 7 ([1 1 1], and then 6 [0 1 1]
