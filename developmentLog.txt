Newest version uses bitwise operators instead of manually instatiating base representations. Soon will be made functional as command line tool
Multithreading will be added
Ran 10,000 elements in 7 seconds and 100,000 in 12:30. This is a vast speedup 13X from original cpp version, and 51X from original python code
Seems to be a more pronounced difference for larger problems
Multithreading/parralelism added
Command line tool finished. Ready for use
